Notes and sample files for Debian Packaging Tutorial, first delivered at ManLUG on 19th January 2013.

The notes are stored in Plain Old Documentation (POD) format. You can build a PDF version by running the following command:

If you don't have the pod2pdf binary, it can be installed via the pod2pdf package in Debian and Ubuntu.
