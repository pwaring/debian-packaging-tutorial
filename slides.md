# What is Packaging?

 - Software + installation rules + dependencies list
 - `apt-get install php5`
 
# Packaging Systems

 - Debian: deb/apt
 - RedHat: rpm/yum
 - Gentoo: ebuild/emerge
 
# Why Package?

 - No package exists
 - Package out of date
 - Wrong build options
 - Not on your architecture
 - Application deployment

# Helper Scripts

 - `cpan2deb` etc.
 - Fine for private use
 - Insufficient for submission to archives
